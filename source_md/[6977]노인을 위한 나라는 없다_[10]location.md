**Introduction: The Revelation**

Spatial analysis requires distinct discernment. Initial readings often prove superficial. One might assume the relationship between **Diegetic Marfa, Texas**, and the **Extradiegetic Marfa filming locations** is the primary tension, given the town's minimal screen time despite its geographic fame. Or perhaps view the use of **Extradiegetic Piedras Negras** to depict **Diegetic Mexican border towns** as merely a logistical convenience for cross-border continuity. However, the film's true spatial significance emerges elsewhere. The profound dislocation occurs between the **Diegetic 1980 West Texas Borderlands** and the **Extradiegetic 2006 Las Vegas, New Mexico**. This analysis asserts that the film’s portrayal of a lawless, decaying moral landscape is not merely a set design choice, but a byproduct of the "New Mexico Film Production Tax Credit Act," which transformed the economically stagnant town of Las Vegas, NM, into a commodified ghost of Texas, effectively proving that the "Old West" is no longer a place, but a subsidized simulation.

**Body: The Investigation**

**The Incentivized frontier**
Incentives redraw the American map. Economics dictated this specific migration.
*   **The 25% Rebate Reality:** In 2006, the Extradiegetic reality was defined by the "New Mexico Film Production Tax Credit Act" (enacted 2002). This legislation offered a 25% refund on production costs, a financial mechanism that literally terraformed the American film landscape. Texas, the Diegetic location, lacked comparable incentives at the time, forcing the production to physically exile the narrative from its "home" to remain financially viable.
*   **The Mercenary Geography:** This creates a profound tension: the Diegetic narrative is about the intrusion of cold, calculated, drug-money capitalism (Anton Chigurh) destroying the "soul" of the old Texas. Paradoxically, the Extradiegetic production abandoned the actual Texas for New Mexico solely due to cold, calculated capitalism. The film’s creation mimics the very force of displacement its villain represents.

**Preservation Through Stagnation**
Decay preserves history for profit. Las Vegas, New Mexico, sells stagnation.
*   **The Architecture of Atrophy:** The filmmakers required a location that visually arrested the timeline in 1980. Las Vegas, NM, served this purpose perfectly not because of set dressing, but because of Extradiegetic economic depression. The town’s lack of modernization between 1980 and 2006 allowed it to "play" the past without modification.
*   **The Douglas Avenue Paradox:** On Douglas Avenue in Las Vegas, NM, the storefronts and the iconic Serf Theatre provided the requisite emptiness. The Diegetic "no man's land" of Terrell County is actually an Extradiegetic urban center that has been hollowed out. The diegetic hopelessness of Sheriff Bell is inextricably linked to the real-world socioeconomic stasis of the filming location, where the only booming industry is the simulation of other places.

**The Horizon Betrays the Lie**
The horizon betrays the lie. Topography contradicts the narrative script.
*   **Geologic dissonance:** West Texas is geologically defined by the Edwards Plateau and the vast, flat Permian Basin. However, the Extradiegetic New Mexico locations are situated in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains foothills. This results in a visual distortion where the "Texas" on screen features looming blue peaks and high-desert scrub that do not exist in the diegetic setting.
*   **The Illegible Space:** This geographic error illuminates a critical theorist insight: The "West" is no longer a specific coordinate, but a generic "Anywhere." By accepting New Mexico as Texas, the audience participates in the erasure of local specificity. The Diegetic space becomes a mythological theater, unmoored from the reality of the land, further emphasizing the film's title—there is no country (specific geography) left, only a generalized landscape of violence.

**Conclusion: The Impact**

The West is a ghost. Reality and fiction ultimately collapse. By utilizing Las Vegas, New Mexico, to represent the lost borderlands of Texas, *No Country for Old Men* inadvertently documents a modern American truth: authenticity is too expensive to film. The Diegetic mourning for a lost code of honor is mirrored by the Extradiegetic loss of place, where specific regional identities are interchangeable commodities sold to the highest bidder through tax rebates. The film does not just show a country that is gone; it was filmed in a way that proves it never existed.
