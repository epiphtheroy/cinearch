**Analysis Structure**

**Introduction: The Revelation**

Biblical readings dominate this film.
One might see the house as a corrupted Eden. Or interpret Mark as the serpent of fatalistic nihilism. However, the essential allegory differs. It concerns a crisis of modern epistemology. We identify **Alex’s Paternal Investigation** as the embodiment of **Empirical Positivism**, and **Vera’s "Infidelity"** as the assertion of **Metaphysical Autonomy**. This reading moves beyond domestic tragedy to critique a worldview that believes truth is only that which can be measured, owned, and verified.

**Body: The Evidence**

**The Tyranny of Definitions**

Alex requires concrete data.
He mistakes biological fact for total existential truth.
*   **The Linguistic disconnect:** When Vera announces her pregnancy by saying, "He is not yours," Alex immediately processes this through a biological, possessive lens. He cannot conceive that she is speaking phenomenologically—that the child is a gift from God (or Nature) and belongs to itself.
*   **The interrogation:** Alex’s subsequent actions are an investigation rather than a conversation; he demands names, dates, and locations. This mirrors the Positivist's rejection of any variable that cannot be empirically categorized or logically deduced.
*   **The rejection of faith:** Vera asks for acceptance without explanation, representing the "leap of faith." Alex’s refusal to leap signifies the modern rationalist's inability to accept ambiguity or the "Sacred" without dissecting it first.

**The Geometry of Silence**

Visuals reinforce this rigid mindset.
Zvyagintsev traps Alex within strict, linear frames.
*   **Architectural entrapment:** The cinematography consistently places Alex within doorways, window frames, and the sharp lines of the car. This visual imprisonment symbolizes the limitations of the rational mind, which constructs boxes (categories) that eventually isolate the subject from the organic flow of life.
*   **The puzzle motif:** The children are seen assembling a jigsaw puzzle. This serves as a metonym for Alex’s worldview: he believes life is a set of fragmented pieces that, if forced together correctly, will yield a clear, static picture.
*   **Industrial intrusion:** The stark contrast between Alex’s metallic, high-performance car and the timeless, rolling hills of the countryside visualizes the friction between his mechanical logic and Vera’s organic, chaotic nature.

**The Surgical Excision of Grace**

Logic seeks to purge mystery.
The abortion represents the destruction of the sacred.
*   **Mark as the regulator:** Mark acts as the enforcer of this systemic logic, advising the removal of the "problem" to restore order. He represents the cold utilitarianism that often accompanies rigid materialism—if an element (the fetus/mystery) disrupts the system, it must be excised.
*   **The false resolution:** The abortion is performed to restore the status quo of Alex's ownership. However, by applying a mechanical solution to a spiritual problem, Alex destroys the "Signified" (the life/meaning) in a desperate attempt to control the "Signifier" (the paternity).
*   **The final irony:** The revelation that the child was biologically his is not a twist of fate, but a condemnation of his lack of intuition. Empirical evidence arrived too late; his reliance on proof over trust resulted in the annihilation of his own legacy.

**Conclusion: The Impact**

The tragedy is self-inflicted.
Positivism kills the very life it seeks to classify. By viewing *Izgnanie* through this lens, the film transforms from a retelling of the Annunciation into a cautionary tale about the modern intellect. It suggests that when we demand to fully know and own the world through cold logic, we inadvertently banish ourselves from the realm of meaning, leaving us distinct, correct, and utterly alone.
