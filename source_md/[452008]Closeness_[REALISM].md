**1. The Nexus**

Kantemir Balagov’s *Closeness* is a vice. It does not merely depict the North Caucasus of the late 1990s; it compresses the viewer within the suffocating geometric logic of tribal loyalty. This film is a nexus of bruised intimacy, where love is indistinguishable from capture and the family unit operates as a hostage situation. By stepping outside the cinematic frame, we locate the film’s pulse in the lived realities of theorists, artists, and witnesses who grappled with the same devastating paradoxes. This curation is a cartography of suffocation and release, placing Balagov’s brutal vision in dialogue with the architects of human anxiety.

**2. The Curation**

**Louise Bourgeois (Artist/Sculptor, French-American, 1911-2010)**
The mother is a spider. She weaves protection that imprisons. Bourgeois famously materialized this paradox in her monumental sculpture *Maman*, depicting the mother as a towering arachnid—simultaneously a shelter and a predator. This duality is the central nervous system of *Closeness*. Ila’s mother is not merely a parent; she is a Bourgeoisian archetype, spinning a web of guilt and fierce tribal love that threatens to digest her children. The film’s claustrophobic 4:3 aspect ratio mirrors the spatial compression found in Bourgeois’s *Cells* installations, where domestic objects are caged in wire mesh. Both the artist and the film reveal that the home is the original site of trauma. Viewing Ila’s struggle through Bourgeois’s lens reveals that her rebellion is not just teenage angst, but a frantic attempt to avoid being eaten alive.

**Susan Sontag (Cultural Critic/Writer, American, 1933-2004)**
Images demand an ethical response. Sontag dissected how we consume atrocity. In her seminal work *Regarding the Pain of Others*, she interrogates the voyeuristic shock of war photography and the moral numbness that follows. This resonates violently with the snuff film scene in *Closeness*, where characters gather to watch a blurry execution video from Chechnya. Balagov refuses to cut away, forcing the audience into the same complicit gaze Sontag critiqued. The characters’ reactions—ranging from horror to stoic endurance—illustrate Sontag’s thesis that images of violence can create a "negative epiphany." The film operationalizes Sontag’s theory, transforming the screen into a mirror that questions the morality of looking. To watch is to be implicated.

**Édouard Louis (Writer, French, 1992-Present)**
Escape is a violent act. One must destroy their origins. In his autobiographical novel *The End of Eddy*, Louis chronicles his desperate flight from a working-class French village defined by toxic masculinity and economic stagnation. His trajectory is the spiritual twin of Ila’s. Both figures inhabit a "tight" provincial space where deviation is punished with physical and psychological violence. Louis articulates the specific crushing weight of factory towns and the inescapable mandate to conform to gender norms. Ila’s tomboyish aesthetic and her rejection of the "good Jewish daughter" script mirror Louis’s rejection of his birth name and identity. Placing them together illuminates the brutal truth: for some, the family is not a support system, but the first enemy line.

**Svetlana Alexievich (Investigative Journalist, Belarusian, 1948-Present)**
History is a domestic catastrophe. The Soviet collapse left wreckage behind. Alexievich’s oral history, *Secondhand Time*, captures the disorientation of the "Homo Sovieticus" drifting in the ruins of an empire, a context vital to Balagov’s Nalchik. *Closeness* is the visual manifestation of Alexievich’s polyphonic voices; it portrays a world where money has suddenly replaced ideology, and human life is transacted in dollars. The desperate parents in the film, scrambling to pay a ransom, are the exact subjects Alexievich interviews—people for whom the grand narrative of history has dissolved into a petty, violent struggle for survival. The aesthetic of the film—teal walls, cramped kitchens, cheap tracksuits—is the texture of the world Alexievich documented. They share a geography of loss.

**René Girard (Historian/Philosopher, French, 1923-2015)**
Violence acts like a contagion. Communities require victims to cohere. Girard’s theory of "mimetic desire" and the "scapegoat mechanism," detailed in *Violence and the Sacred*, provides the anthropological skeleton of the film’s kidnapping plot. The Kabardian kidnappers and the Jewish community are locked in a mimetic rivalry, defining themselves against one another yet bound by the same brutal logic of exchange. The kidnapping is a ritualized act intended to restore order or assert dominance. Girard argues that sacrifice is the glue of primitive societies; Balagov shows this mechanism operating in 1998. The film suggests that to maintain the "tribe," someone must always be sold. Viewing the narrative through Girard reveals the kidnapping not as a crime, but as a ritual.

**Nan Goldin (Photographer, American, 1953-Present)**
Intimacy is often a bruise. Love and violence share a bed. Goldin’s slideshow *The Ballad of Sexual Dependency* revolutionized photography by documenting her "tribe" in moments of raw, unvarnished vulnerability. Balagov’s visual language in *Closeness*—the jarring color palette, the uncomfortable proximity to skin, the sweat—is cinematically Goldinesque. Both artists reject the sanitized image of youth. Ila, with her grease-stained overalls and aggressive sexuality, could effortlessly inhabit a Goldin photograph. The "closeness" in the title refers to the same suffocating dependency Goldin captures: the inability to separate from those who hurt you. The camera does not observe; it intrudes. It captures the terror of being known too well.

**Sarah Kane (Playwright, British, 1971-1999)**
Cruelty can be a language. Love is not enough to save us. Kane’s "In-Yer-Face" theatre, particularly plays like *Blasted*, utilized shock and brutality to puncture the audience’s apathy, mirroring the abrasive texture of *Closeness*. Kane’s work is characterized by a claustrophobic intensity where characters tear each other apart in confined spaces, seeking connection through destruction. Ila’s sexual encounter, which teeters on the edge of assault and desperate need, is pure Kane. The playwright’s assertion that the most violent acts are often expressions of thwarted love unlocks the behavior of Balagov’s characters. They hurt because they do not know how to speak. The film is a scenic extension of Kane’s tragic, brutal universe.

**Emmanuel Levinas (Philosopher, French-Lithuanian, 1906-1995)**
Ethics begins with the face. We are hostage to the Other. Levinas posited that the face of another person issues an infinite demand for responsibility, a philosophy tested to its breaking point in *Closeness*. The film’s central conflict is the collision between tribal obligation (Levinas’s "Totality") and the ethical demand of the outsider. The Jewish community’s insularity is challenged by the reality of their Kabardian neighbors. When Ila interacts with her Kabardian boyfriend, she is attempting a Levinasian leap across the ethical abyss. The extreme close-ups in the film force the viewer to encounter the "face" in the most literal sense. Levinas provides the moral stakes: the tragedy is the failure to see the human beneath the tribal marker.

**Anna Politkovskaya (Journalist, Russian, 1958-2006)**
Truth dies in the dark. She reported from the bleeding edge. Politkovskaya’s fearless reporting on the Second Chechen War exposes the geopolitical radiation poisoning the atmosphere of *Closeness*. While the film is a domestic drama, the war in Chechnya is the invisible monster in the room, manifesting in the snuff film and the omnipresent threat of violence. Politkovskaya documented the lawlessness and the normalization of brutality in the North Caucasus that Balagov dramatizes. Her eventual assassination underscores the reality of the danger Ila flirts with. To understand the specific frequency of fear in the film’s background, one must read Politkovskaya’s *A Small Corner of Hell*. The film is the fiction; her work was the fact.

**Slavenka Drakulić (Journalist/Novelist, Croatian, 1949-Present)**
Neighbors turn into enemies overnight. The familiar becomes the lethal. In *The Taste of a Man* and her non-fiction on the Balkan wars, Drakulić examines how ethnic nationalism poisons the intimacy of daily life. This is the precise geopolitical frequency of Balagov’s Nalchik. Just as Drakulić chronicled how the Yugoslav "brotherhood" disintegrated into fratricide, *Closeness* depicts a society where the proximity of Jewish and Kabardian communities breeds contempt rather than understanding. Drakulić’s analysis of the "banality of evil" in post-communist states—where violence becomes a pragmatic tool for survival—illuminates the kidnappers' motivations. They are not monsters; they are neighbors operating under a collapsed morality.

**3. The Horizon**

*Closeness* ceases to be a mere narrative of abduction when refracted through these lives. It becomes a convergence point for the art of trauma, the philosophy of the face, and the journalism of collapse. By witnessing the film alongside Bourgeois’s spiders or Politkovskaya’s war reports, we acknowledge that the screen is not a barrier. It is a membrane through which the timeless, crushing archetypes of human tribalism and the desperate clawing for individual breath continue to bleed.
