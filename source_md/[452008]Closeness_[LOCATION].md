**Introduction: The Revelation**

Spatial analysis often proves superficial.
Consider the film’s interior sets. One might assume the relationship between the **Diegetic cramped apartments** and the **Extradiegetic St. Petersburg soundstages** is merely a logistical necessity to accommodate camera equipment. Or perhaps view the use of **Extradiegetic archival footage** to depict the **Diegetic Chechen War reality** as a simple historical anchor. These readings, while functional, fail to unearth the film's geological pressure. However, the film's true spatial significance emerges elsewhere. The profound tension lies in the friction between **Diegetic Nalchik (1998)**, a suffocating zone of ethnic tribulation, and **Extradiegetic Nalchik (2016)**, the actual production site that has largely suppressed the memory of the trauma depicted. The film functions not as a period piece, but as a forensic exhumation of the North Caucasus, forcing the physical landscape to confess to the ethnic cleansing and silence that paved the modern city.

**Body: The Investigation**

### The Architecture of Geographic Entrapment

Nalchik is a geographical prison.
The camera never captures the horizon.
*   **The 4:3 Aspect Ratio as Spatial border:** The **Diegetic Space** of 1998 is defined by a lack of exit routes; the characters are trapped between the Kabardian traditions and the looming Chechen War. The **Extradiegetic** decision to shoot in the Academy ratio (4:3) rather than widescreen creates a literal, optical claustrophobia. The "closeness" is not just emotional; it is a denial of the peripheral vision of the landscape.
*   **The Missing Mountains:** Geographically, Nalchik is situated in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. However, the production deliberately frames shots to obscure the majesty of the natural landscape. In the **Extradiegetic Reality**, the mountains represent tourism and regional pride; in the film, they are visually censored to reinforce the **Diegetic** sensation that the city is a sealed concrete box from which the Jewish protagonist, Ila, cannot escape.
*   **The Economy of Dead Space:** The film utilizes the drab, industrial wasteland of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic. The production did not dress these locations to look "retro"; they utilized the stagnant economic reality of the 2016 filming locations to prove that for this region, 1998 never truly ended. The spatial stagnation of the filming site validates the narrative hopelessness.

### The Cartography of Tribal Erasure

Tribalism dictates the city map.
Boundaries are invisible yet lethal.
*   **The Jewish Enclave:** The narrative centers on the kidnapping of a couple from a Jewish family in a predominantly Kabardian and Muslim region. The **Diegetic Space** portrays a distinct Jewish community structure. The **Extradiegetic Reality** of shooting in Nalchik reveals a ghostly void; the mass exodus of Jews from the North Caucasus (a direct result of the specific kidnappings and violence depicted in the film) means the production was filming in the footprint of a vanished demographic.
*   **The Garage as a Site of Transaction:** Key scenes occur in automotive garages and nondescript workshops. In the **Diegetic** narrative, these are places of ransom negotiation. In the **Extradiegetic** socio-political context of the North Caucasus, these "gray zone" economies remain the lifeblood of the region, operating outside federal Russian oversight. The film documents the actual spaces where the shadow economy of the 90s transitioned into the normalized corruption of the 2010s.
*   **Exhuming the Silenced Narrative:** Director Kantemir Balagov, a native of Nalchik, faced local resistance during production. The **Extradiegetic** populace was hostile toward resurrecting the memory of the anti-Semitic crimes of the late 90s, preferring the narrative of "friendship of peoples." By filming on the very streets where these crimes were obfuscated, the film performs a hostile takeover of the city’s collective memory.

### The Pornography of Real Death

Real violence invades the fiction.
The screen becomes a witness.
*   **The Dagestan Massacre Tape:** The film’s most controversial moment occurs when the characters watch a "snuff film" on VHS. This is not a prop; it is **Extradiegetic archival footage** of the 1999 Tukhchar massacre, where Russian soldiers were executed by Chechen militants.
*   **Spatial Collapse:** This scene collapses the distance between the viewer and the location. The characters are in a **Diegetic** living room in Nalchik, safe but proximate to the war. The **Extradiegetic** insertion of unsimulated death ruptures the fictional contract. It reminds the viewer that the North Caucasus is not merely a film set for family drama, but a tangible geography soaked in documented bloodshed.
*   **The Ethics of the Location:** By forcing the audience to watch this footage within the context of a fictional narrative, Balagov highlights the proximity of the conflict. The "closeness" refers to the geographical intimacy of the war—Nalchik is frighteningly close to the border of Chechnya. The location is not a backdrop; it is a silent participant in the regional slaughter.

**Conclusion: The Impact**

Geography acts as active memory.
The city cannot hide its scars.
Ultimately, *Closeness* serves as a counter-map to the official Russian state narrative of the North Caucasus. By superimposing the **Diegetic** trauma of 1998 onto the **Extradiegetic** pavement of modern Nalchik, the film reveals that the physical space acts as a container for unresolved ethnic tension. The location does not merely host the story; it indicts the history that the region has attempted to bury, proving that in this specific corner of the world, the past is not a foreign country—it is the very ground beneath the camera.
