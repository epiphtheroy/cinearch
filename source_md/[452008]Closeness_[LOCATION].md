**Introduction: The Revelation**

One might critique the interiors. specifically, the choice to film cramped apartments on St. Petersburg soundstages. Or perhaps view the use of 2016 Nalchik to depict 1998 as merely logistical. These readings ignore the geopolitical weight.

However, the film’s true spatial significance emerges elsewhere. The profound friction exists between the **Diegetic Enclosed Jewish Enclave (Nalchik, North Caucasus, 1998)** and the **Extradiegetic Indigenous Cinematic Reclamation (The Sokurov Workshop at KBSU, Nalchik, 2016)**. This pairing reveals a paradox: the production represents a historic opening of regional cultural expression, yet it utilizes that freedom to depict a narrative of suffocating ethnic entrapment.

**Body: The Investigation**

**The Geopolitics of Instruction**
Geography dictates the narrative voice. This film is an act of regional defiance.
*   **Decentralized Production:** The Extradiegetic reality is defined by Alexander Sokurov’s decision to bypass Moscow and establish a film workshop at Kabardino-Balkarian State University in Nalchik. This 2010 initiative was a radical socio-spatial intervention designed to empower North Caucasian voices to represent their own geography.
*   **The Insider/Outsider Paradox:** While the production mechanism (the Workshop) represents Indigenous empowerment and the "claiming" of Nalchik by locals, the narrative focuses on a Jewish family who feels threatened by that very local population. The diegesis frames the Kabardians—the people making the film—as the source of danger and extortion.
*   **Authenticity as Threat:** By utilizing local non-actors and shooting on location in the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic, Balagov transforms the "liberated" space of the production into a diegetic prison for his protagonists. The reality of 2016's cultural blossoming provides the texture for 1998's ethnic claustrophobia.

**Framing as Spatial Violence**
Space is weaponized through framing. The camera refuses to show the horizon line.
*   **The 1.33:1 Constraint:** The film utilizes a squarish aspect ratio, literally cropping the geography of the North Caucasus. While the Extradiegetic location offers the vast, mountainous vistas of the Caucasus Mountains (often romanticized in Russian Imperial literature), the film denies this view.
*   **Architectural Oppression:** The diegetic space is restricted to the industrial and Soviet-era concrete brutalism of Nalchik’s urban sprawl. The production actively suppresses the natural beauty of the shooting location to mirror the protagonists' lack of economic and social mobility.
*   **Proxemic Tension:** The decision to film in the actual cramped spaces of regional mechanics' garages and disco halls creates a tangible "haptic visuality." The viewer is forced into the physical intimacy of the location, erasing the safety of distance usually afforded by cinematic geography.

**The Intrusion of The Real**
Reality breaches the fictional container. A VHS tape disrupts the cinematic illusion completely.
*   **The Dagestan Massacre:** The narrative is halted for the characters to watch a "snuff film" on a VHS tape. This footage is not a fabrication; it is actual archival footage of the 1999 massacre of Russian soldiers in Tukhchar, Dagestan, near the filming location.
*   **Geographic Bleed:** This moment collapses the diegetic and extradiegetic divide. The violence shown is a historical reality of the North Caucasus region, bleeding into the fictional narrative of the Jewish kidnapping. It reminds the viewer that the location of the production is a site of genuine, documented trauma.
*   **Temporal Collapse:** By inserting real 1999 footage into a film shot in 2016, Balagov uses the location’s bloody history to validate the fictional fear. The geography itself acts as a witness, refusing to let the fiction sanitize the violence of the Second Chechen War era.

**Conclusion: The Impact**

Balagov weaponizes the local geography. The location is not a backdrop; it is an antagonist.

This spatial analysis reveals *Closeness* not merely as a family drama, but as a complex artifact of post-Soviet decolonization. The film demonstrates that the **Extradiegetic** act of a region reclaiming its own image (the Sokurov Workshop) requires a painful confrontation with the **Diegetic** history of ethnic exclusion and violence embedded in that very soil. The "closeness" is not just emotional; it is the physical pressure of history bearing down on a specific coordinate on the map.
