The rain does not stop.
It falls like a heavy curtain over the broken world. From the blackened, rotting timber of the great gate, water cascades in sheets, turning the earth into a shapeless mire of mud and gloom. This deluge is not merely weather; it is the physical manifestation of confusion, a relentless gray wash that dissolves the sharp edges of reality until we can no longer distinguish the solid ground from the swamp. We sit huddled beneath the decaying roof, shivering not just from the cold, but from the terrifying realization that human honesty is as porous as the wood rotting above our heads. In this drowning atmosphere, the truth is not a jewel to be found, but a ghost that slips through wet fingers, leaving only the chill of uncertainty behind.

Shadows play tricks on us.
Sunlight pierces leaves like jagged shards of glass. When we venture away from the gate and into the tangled forest where the tragedy unfolded, the world becomes a labyrinth of dappled light and deceiving shade. The sun, usually a symbol of clarity, here blinds us, flashing in hypnotic rhythms that make us question our own eyes. Each character walks a different path through these same woods, and each path is overgrown with the vines of their own vanity. The bandit, the wife, the samurai—they do not describe what happened; they describe who they wish to be, painting their sins with the bright, desperate colors of heroism or tragic victimhood to hide the dull gray of their shame.

We cannot bear our reflections.
The truth is a knife we fear to hold. It is far easier to construct a fortress of lies than to stand naked before the judgment of our own conscience. The tragedy is not the murder itself, but the revelation that the human soul is a soft, malleable clay that reshapes history to protect its fragile ego. We watch them weave their tapestries of deceit, realizing with a sinking heart that they lie not to deceive the court, but to deceive themselves. They would rather be remembered as fierce demons or sorrowful spirits than admit to being small, frightened, and foolish, proving that we are often more terrified of looking ridiculous than we are of being wicked.

Yet, the storm eventually breaks.
A cry rises from the shadows of the gate. Just as the cynicism threatens to swallow us whole, the weeping of an abandoned child cuts through the relentless sound of the rain. The clouds pull back, not to reveal a burning sun of absolute truth, but to offer a gentle, quiet light that allows for a single act of mercy. The woodcutter’s choice to take the child is not a solution to the mystery, but a redemption of the spirit, a suggestion that while truth may be forever lost in the forest, kindness remains the only compass that can lead us out of the ruins. We are left standing in the clearing air, watching a man walk away with a burden of hope, understanding finally that the only truth that matters is the one we create through our compassion.
