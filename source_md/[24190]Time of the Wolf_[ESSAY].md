**The Fog Eats Everything**

The fog eats everything.
It swallows the trees and road.
It is not merely weather, but a heavy, wet curtain drawn across the stage of history, muffling the cries of those who wander through the damp chill. Here, civilization is not a structure of brick and law, but a memory that is rapidly dissolving like salt in rain, leaving only the bitter taste of fear on the tongue. The world has become a vast, unlit room where the furniture has been rearranged in the dark, and we are left bruising our shins against the sharp edges of our own desperation.

**Consider the Boy, Ben**

Consider the boy, Ben.
He stands near the roaring fire.
He is a small, pale ghost haunting the edges of a purgatory that the adults have created but cannot control. In this broken world, silence is a heavy blanket that suffocates hope, yet he seeks to tear through it with a singular, terrible act of burning. He believes that the universe demands a blood price for the return of the sun, imagining his own small body as the final coin to be dropped into a cosmic tollbooth that has long since closed down. The fire crackles with the indifferent laughter of ancient gods who are no longer listening to our prayers.

**Shadows Hold Us Now**

Shadows hold us now.
We are stripped of our names.
It is a slow unraveling, like a grand tapestry pulled thread by thread until the intricate picture of humanity is just a pile of tangled yarn on a dirty floor. We huddle together not out of love, but out of the desperate, shivering need for warmth, like stray dogs waiting for a master who will never return to unlock the door. The wolf is not at the door; the wolf is the door, and we have walked through it into the belly of a beast that digests time itself.

**The Tracks Lead Nowhere**

The tracks lead nowhere.
Movement is our only prayer left.
As the landscape blurs past the dirty glass, we realize that we are merely passengers on a vessel drifting through a twilight that holds no promise of dawn. The world does not end with a bang, but with the quiet, rhythmic clattering of wheels against steel, carrying us deeper into the beautiful, terrifying mystery of an eternal night.
