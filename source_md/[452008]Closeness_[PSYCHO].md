**Introduction: The Revelation**

Interpretations often miss the mark. One could blame teenage rebellion. Indeed, one might assume Ilana’s defiant sexuality with her Kabardian boyfriend is a clear case of the Freudian Oedipal revolt against the Father. Or perhaps view her apathy toward the execution video as a simple manifestation of the Death Drive or desensitization to violence. However, the behavior’s true psychological significance lies elsewhere.

The narrative’s core conflict is not external. It is an internal collapse. We must examine **Ilana’s paradoxical violent immobility** through the lens of **Julia Kristeva’s Theory of Abjection**. Ilana does not merely fight her family; she is engaged in a primal, failed struggle to separate her own ego from the suffocating, "abject" body of the family unit, specifically the Mother, creating a crisis where the boundaries between self and other are horrifyingly dissolved.

**Body: The Investigation**

### The Horror of the Arch-Mother

The mother is a threat. She represents a swallowing void. In *Closeness*, the titular sensation is not warmth, but asphyxiation.
*   **The Collapse of Boundaries:** According to Kristeva, the "abject" is that which "disturbs identity, system, order." It is the primal repulsiveness of the maternal body that the child must reject to become an autonomous "I." Ilana’s physical violence toward her mother—the biting, the wrestling, the screaming—is not hatred, but a panicked attempt to establish a boundary where none exists.
*   **Engulfment Anxiety:** The family exists in a state of incestuous emotional claustrophobia. The mother treats Ilana not as a daughter, but as a limb of herself. When Ilana lashes out, she is reacting to the threat of re-engulfment—the fear of being swallowed back into the pre-verbal, undifferentiated state of the womb.
*   **The Failure of Expulsion:** Kristeva argues that the subject must "abject" the mother to enter the Symbolic Order (society/language). Ilana fails to do this. She is stuck in the nauseating zone of the abject, simultaneously repulsed by and addicted to the toxicity of her mother's love.

### The Garage as Armor

Ilana hides in heavy grease. It is her chosen armor. Her rejection of traditional femininity is a defense mechanism against the abject.
*   **Rejection of the "Clean" Body:** By working as a mechanic and covering herself in dirt and oil, Ilana physically manifests the abject. She wears "filth" to repel the "clean" narrative her mother desires—marriage, domesticity, and social climbing.
*   **Symbiosis with the Father:** While the Mother represents the swallowing void, the Father’s garage offers a transitional space. However, this is a fragile defense. Ilana tries to align herself with the Father to escape the Mother, but in this insular community, the Father is too weak to separate the dyad. He is also trapped in the "closeness."
*   **Somatic Protest:** Her body is her only language. When words fail (the Symbolic), she reverts to the Semiotic (the pre-linguistic drive). Her erratic movements, her rough dancing, and her sexual acting out are somatic protests against a psychic structure that allows her no space to breathe.

### The Refusal of Exchange

Money cannot solve this trauma. The kidnapping is a catalyst. The central plot point—the kidnapping of her brother David and his bride—demands a ransom, forcing the family into an economic exchange.
*   **Resisting the Symbolic Pact:** The community demands Ilana marry a wealthy suitor to secure the ransom money. This is a transaction within the Symbolic Order: trading a daughter for a son. Ilana’s refusal is a rejection of becoming a currency. She refuses to be "exchanged" because she has not yet fully constituted herself as a separate entity capable of being traded.
*   **The Sacrifice of the Self:** Instead of marrying for money, she offers her body to her boyfriend, Zalim, and creates chaos. She courts danger to feel the edges of her own existence.
*   **The Scream:** In the film's climax, her anguish is not about the brother's safety, but the realization that the family prefers the "idea" of the son over the "reality" of the daughter. She is the abject waste product of the family's desire to survive.

**Conclusion: The Leap**

Ilana remains paradoxically trapped. Escape is never truly captured. Despite the violence, the screaming, and the trauma, the film ends with Ilana in the car with her parents, moving forward but going nowhere. We have witnessed a failed separation. The "closeness" has healed over the wound of her attempted individuality like a keloid scar.

This leads to a terrifying question. Does the film suggest that in the context of profound tribal and familial trauma, love is indistinguishable from cannibalism? Perhaps *Closeness* posits that for the survivor of such suffocating intimacy, true identity is impossible, and the only choice is to be digested by the ones who love you most.
