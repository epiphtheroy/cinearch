**Introduction: The Revelation**

Interpretations vary wildly here.
One might allege a failure of W.K. Clifford’s epistemic responsibility. In this view, Young-hwan’s summoning of his sons based on a vague, unverified "feeling" of death constitutes a violation of the ethics of belief—acting on insufficient evidence. Or perhaps one views his choice as a Kierkegaardian conflict, where the aesthetic sphere (his obsession with the beauty of the two female strangers) brutally overrides the ethical sphere (his duty to his progeny). However, the action's true ethical significance emerges elsewhere.

The deepest crisis lies in the tension between **Heideggerian Being-towards-death and Levinasian Responsibility**.

Young-hwan’s pivotal action—inviting his sons to the hotel for a "final" reunion, only to emotionally abandon them for the company of strangers and his own solitude—exposes the toxic side of existential authenticity. It reveals a character who attempts to orchestrate his own finitude, treating his family not as ethical subjects, but as props in his final performance of mortality.

**Body: The Investigation**

**The Egoism of Authenticity**
Death becomes a private performance.
Young-hwan privileges his internal mood over external reality.
*   **Heidegger’s *Sein-zum-Tode* (Being-towards-death):** Young-hwan is consumed by the Heideggerian concept of authentic existence, which requires confronting one's own death as a non-transferable possibility. He believes that by acknowledging his imminent demise (the "feeling"), he is achieving a higher state of being.
*   **The Narrative Trap:** However, he misapplies this philosophy. Instead of accepting death as part of life structure, he dramatizes it. By summoning his sons, Byung-soo and Kyung-soo, he attempts to externalize his internal drama. He wants witnesses to his "authenticity," yet he refuses to engage with *their* reality.
*   **Instrumentalization:** The sons are summoned not to be loved, but to validate the father’s poetic intuition. When their presence becomes too demanding—too "real" with their talk of divorce and failure—he retreats, proving that his "Being-towards-death" is fundamentally a retreat from "Being-with-others" (*Mitsein*).

**The Refusal of the Face**
Proximity does not guarantee intimacy.
Actually, physical nearness often exacerbates ethical distance.
*   **The Levinasian Summons:** Emmanuel Levinas argues that the "Face" of the Other imposes an infinite ethical responsibility upon us, a command that says, "Do not kill me" or "Do not ignore me." By inviting his sons to the hotel, Young-hwan voluntarily places himself before their Countenances.
*   **The Ethical Failure:** Once they arrive, he commits an ethical violence. He consistently turns his face away from his sons—who are desperate for engagement and validation—toward the two women, Sang-hee and Yeon-ju. The women represent an aesthetic, undemanding "Other," whereas the sons represent a demanding, historical "Other."
*   **The Coffee Shop Betrayal:** In the scene where he cuts short his time with his sons to praise the women, he illustrates a failure to prioritize the specific, hard ethical bond of kinship over the generalized, easy appreciation of beauty. He seeks the sublime (the snow, the women, the poem) to escape the ethical messiness of the divorce discussion his son tries to initiate.

**Radical Freedom vs. Paternal Bond**
He seeks a narrative conclusion.
The sons are mere footnotes in his final chapter.
*   **Sartrean Bad Faith:** There is an element of Jean-Paul Sartre’s "Bad Faith" in Young-hwan’s drowsiness and erratic behavior. He claims he "feels" death is near, using this biological fatalism to excuse his social apathy. He uses his impending mortality as a shield to deflect the inquiries of his children.
*   **The Asymmetry of the Gift:** He offers them the "gift" of a final goodbye, but as Jacques Derrida might suggest, a gift that asserts power and demands gratitude without reciprocity is a poisoning. He wants to be the dying patriarch without doing the work of the living father.
*   **Silence as Aggression:** His sudden naps and refusal to explain his feelings constitute a passive-aggressive assertion of power. He dictates the terms of engagement. The ethical dilemma here is profound: Does the proximity of death grant one the right to radical selfishness, or does it heighten the obligation to settle one's ethical accounts?

**Conclusion: The Leap**

The poet dies alone.
His solitude is both a punishment and a choice.
Young-hwan’s action illuminates the terrifying incompatibility between the artistic impulse to curate one's life (and death) and the messy, uncurated demands of human relationships. He succeeds in his Heideggerian project—he dies authentically, on his own terms—but fails the Levinasian test, leaving his sons ethically destitute, staring at a void where a father should be.

Here is the final question.
We judge Young-hwan for prioritizing his poetic intuition over his sons, yet we must ask: **Is the artistic temperament fundamentally incompatible with ethical life?** If the artist's primary loyalty is to the truth of their own perception (the "feeling" of death), does this necessitate a degree of sociopathy that renders them incapable of true ethical communion? Perhaps Young-hwan’s tragedy is not that he was a bad father, but that he was too committed to being a "true" poet, suggesting that art, in its purest form, might be an enemy to the Good.
