**Introduction: The Revelation**

Interpretations often remain superficial.
One might view the **Hotel** as **Purgatory**. In this reading, the characters drift in a liminal space, suspended between life and death, awaiting judgment amidst the encroaching white void. Alternatively, critics could interpret the omnipresent **Snow** as **Historical Amnesia**. Here, the blanketing whiteness signifies a cultural desire to erase the traumas of the past, leaving only a blank slate where context dissolves. However, the most essential allegory lies elsewhere.

The film operates as a critique of authorship itself.
Specifically, **The Poet Young-hwan** serves as the Signifier for **The Collapse of Patriarchal Narrative Authority**. Hong Sang-soo does not merely present a story about an aging man; he presents a semiotic autopsy of the "Great Man" mythos, exposing how male artistic ego attempts—and fails—to colonize reality.

**Body: The Evidence**

**The Predatory Gaze of Syntax**
Consider the poet's gaze.
It is not benign; it is inextricably predatory. Young-hwan spends much of the film observing the two women, Sang-hee and Yeon-ju, from a distance or through windows. He is not engaging with them as human beings; he is reducing them to metaphors to populate the final stanza of his life.

*   **The Window as Frame:** The repeated shots of Young-hwan watching the women walking in the snow position him as the "author" trying to impose a plot upon them. The window frame acts as the cinema screen; he is the passive director trying to claim their image.
*   **"Angels" as Reductive Labeling:** When he finally approaches them, he calls them "angels." This is not a compliment; it is a semiotic violence that strips them of their complex, messy humanity (their heartbreak, their fatigue) and flattens them into divine archetypes meant to serve his spiritual redemption.
*   **The Unprompted Poem:** He forces a poem upon them later in the film. This act signifies the desperation of the Patriarchal Narrative to inscribe meaning onto the female body, desperate to leave a mark before its own expiration.

**The Impotence of Dynastic Succession**
Observe the summoned sons.
They represent a failed, crumbling, and pathetic dynasty. Young-hwan calls his two sons to the hotel because he senses his impending death, an act that screams of a desire for legacy and continuity. However, the film brutally undermines the concept of patrilineal heritage.

*   **The Ineffectual Heirs:** The sons, Kyung-soo and Byung-soo, are depicted as bumbling and emotionally stunted. They are incapable of understanding their father or comforting him, signifying that the "Old Authority" has nothing viable to pass down.
*   **The Narcissism of the Summons:** The father’s reason for calling them is entirely self-centered—a vague premonition of death. This reflects how traditional narrative structures center male anxiety as the axis of the world, expecting the environment to rearrange itself around the patriarch's ego.
*   **Visual Displacement:** In several scenes, the sons are framed awkwardly or left waiting, emphasizing their irrelevance. The narrative line they are supposed to continue is broken; the "King" is dying, and the princes are unworthy.

**The Resilience of the Unscripted**
Contrast this with the women.
They exist comfortably within the diegetic reality. While the men agonize over legacy, death, and meaning, the women engage in tangible acts of survival and connection—sleeping, eating, and comforting one another.

*   **The Bed Scene:** The profound shot of the two women sleeping together in the hotel room signifies a self-sustaining ecosystem of care that requires no male intervention. They are the "Signified" reality that the poet cannot penetrate or control.
*   **Rejection of the Narrative:** When the poet attempts to insert himself into their dynamic, the interaction is polite but fundamentally awkward. The women’s bond repels his attempt to make the story about *him*.
*   **Survival vs. Theorizing:** The men talk about life; the women live it. The allegory posits that the Patriarchal Narrative is obsessed with ending (death/climax), while the feminine reality is focused on continuity and endurance, rendering the poet's "tragic ending" absurd.

**Conclusion: The Impact**

The allegory is complete.
The poet’s death is a necessary erasure. By viewing Young-hwan not simply as a character, but as the embodiment of an obsolete system of meaning-making, *Hotel by the River* transforms from a melancholic drama into a radical deconstruction. The film posits that the "Great Male Artist" is no longer the orchestrator of truth, but a ghost haunting a world that has already moved on without him. The snow does not cover the world to make it beautiful for the poet; it buries him to clear the way for the living.
