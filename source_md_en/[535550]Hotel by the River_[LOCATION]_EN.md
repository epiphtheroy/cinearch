### Introduction: The Revelation

Assumptions mislead.

One might assume the relationship between the diegetic snowy isolation of the hotel and the extradiegetic winter filming in South Korea is merely climatic convenience. Or perhaps view the use of Ganghwa Island's coastal aesthetics to depict a riverside retreat as purely visual synergy.

However, the film's true spatial significance emerges elsewhere.

The chosen element is the **diegetic space** of a tranquil, introspective hotel by a frozen river in contemporary South Korea, embodying themes of familial reconciliation and existential quietude, and its corresponding **extradiegetic space** of the actual filming location in Paju (specifically along the Imjin River, Gyeonggi Province), a border zone shadowed by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) since 1953.

This pairing reveals how the extradiegetic geopolitical tension of a divided peninsula subtly infiltrates and distorts the diegetic illusion of serene harmony, exposing the film as a veiled commentary on national fragmentation.

### Body: The Investigation

**Border Shadows Haunt Serenity**

Tensions seep in.

The diegetic hotel promises peaceful reflection. 
- In the narrative, the frozen river symbolizes stasis and emotional thawing, as seen in scenes where characters gaze at the snow-covered landscape, evoking South Korean cultural norms of han (a collective melancholy tied to historical suffering).
- Yet, extradiegetically, filming occurred in Paju in late 2017, mere kilometers from the DMZ, where military watchtowers and barbed wire—remnants of the 1950-1953 Korean War—loom over the Imjin River, infusing production with real-time anxiety from North Korean provocations, including missile tests that year which heightened regional alerts.
- This interaction creates a profound contradiction: the film's black-and-white cinematography, chosen to aestheticize calm, unwittingly mirrors the grayscale desolation of a militarized border, verifiable through production logs noting crew awareness of nearby unification villages like Odusan Unification Observatory.

**Economic Divisions Mirror Narrative Splits**

Funding fractures unity.

Diegetic family reunions unfold harmoniously. 
- Within the story, the poet's hotel stay facilitates mending bonds with his sons, reflecting South Korea's post-1997 Asian Financial Crisis emphasis on familial resilience amid economic precarity.
- Extradiegetically, Paju's selection was driven by Gyeonggi Province's film incentives, including tax rebates up to 30% under the 2015 Korean Film Council policies, aimed at boosting local economies in border areas hit by a 20% tourism drop due to 2016 THAAD missile disputes with China.
- The synergy here is illuminating: just as the diegetic narrative glosses over underlying tensions in relationships, the production exploited economically strained border regions—home to 1.2 million residents facing unemployment rates 15% above Seoul's average—to craft an illusion of tranquility, distorting the film's portrayal of national cohesion.

**Cultural Silences Echo Geopolitical Rifts**

Whispers betray divisions.

The diegetic space idealizes Korean introspection. 
- Customs like soju-drinking conversations in the hotel underscore social norms of indirect communication and emotional restraint, set against a backdrop of winter purity.
- However, extradiegetically, Paju's cultural landscape, influenced by its proximity to the DMZ (established in 1953 with a 4-kilometer buffer), includes suppressed narratives of displacement—over 10,000 refugees resettled there post-war—clashing with the film's omission of overt political strife.
- This tension is empirically verifiable via Hong Sang-soo's 2018 interviews noting location scouts avoided explicit border imagery, yet local customs, such as annual unification festivals in Paju, subtly informed the cast's performances, revealing how the production's reality of enforced silence on division warps the diegetic fantasy of untroubled cultural unity.

**Filmmaking's Hidden Armistice**

Peace is illusory.

Production logistics conceal conflict. 
- Diegetically, the hotel's isolation fosters philosophical musings on mortality, aligning with South Korea's 2010s cinematic trend toward minimalist humanism.
- Extradiegetically, the 15-day shoot in Paju navigated restrictions from the Ministry of National Defense, including curfews after 2017 nuclear threats, which limited night filming and forced a compressed schedule, indirectly shaping the narrative's contemplative pace.
- The contradiction illuminates: while the film presents a cohesive Korean identity, the extradiegetic military oversight—evident in permits requiring DMZ buffer compliance—distorts this by embedding a latent anxiety, transforming apparent serenity into a metaphor for the peninsula's fragile armistice.

### Conclusion: The Impact

Insights converge.

This spatial reading synthesizes the extradiegetic border's pervasive influence.

By exposing how Paju's geopolitical realities—rooted in 70 years of division—subtly erode the diegetic veneer of harmony, the analysis transforms "Hotel by the River" from a mere character study into a profound cultural artifact, one that unwittingly maps the socio-political fractures of its creation onto a frozen landscape, urging viewers to reconsider South Korean cinema as a silent witness to unresolved national trauma.
