**Introduction: The Revelation**

Interpretations often miss the mark.
One might view Young-hwan’s fatalism as a death drive.
It is tempting to read the protagonist's sudden conviction of his impending death through the lens of Freud’s *Thanatos*, interpreting his summons of his sons as a final submission to the inorganic. Alternatively, a critic might diagnose his awkward, disjointed interactions with his progeny as a classic failure of the Oedipal Father, where his inability to articulate the law exposes his castration. These readings, while functional, fail to account for the specific affective texture of his neglect.

However, the truth is darker.
His psyche is engaged in a desperate, narcissistic salvage operation.
The behavior's true psychological significance lies in **Young-hwan’s obsessive idealization of the two female strangers and the concurrent emotional abandonment of his sons**. This dynamic is best illuminated by **Jacques Lacan’s concept of the Mirror Stage and the Imaginary Order**. Young-hwan is not preparing to die; he is desperately trying to be reborn through the gaze of the Other, utilizing the women as a fresh reflective surface while discarding his sons as the debris of his shattered ego.

**Body: The Investigation**

### The Suture of the Imaginary
The gaze seeks a mirror.
Young-hwan uses the women to reconstruct his fragmented ego.
Lacan argues that the ego is formed through the *misrecognition* (méconnaissance) of the self in a mirror—seeing a whole, coordinated "ideal I" where there is only a fragmented body.
*   **The Idealized Other:** Young-hwan’s fixation on Yeon-ju and Sang-hee is scopic. He constantly praises their beauty, calling them "angels," and seeks their company over his own flesh and blood. In the Lacanian sense, the women serve as the *specular image*. Because they do not know him intimately, they can reflect back the image he desires: the Wise Poet, the Tragic Figure, the patriarch of gravitas.
*   **Suturing the Rift:** His stated belief that he will die is less a biological reality and more a psychological ploy to reset the symbolic order. By claiming death, he demands attention; by gazing at the women, he sutures the wounds of his guilt. He is addicted to the *Imaginary*, that realm of surface and wholeness, desperately avoiding the depth where his failures reside.

### The Sons as the Traumatic Real
His sons represent the Real.
They are the traumatic residue of his failed history.
While the women belong to the Imaginary, the sons (Kyung-soo and Byung-soo) function as the Lacanian *Real*—that which resists symbolization and cannot be integrated into his fantasy.
*   **The Return of the Repressed:** The presence of the sons disrupts Young-hwan's narcissistic fantasy. They carry the history of his abandonment, his divorce, and his selfishness. Every time he looks at them, the mirror cracks. This explains the discrepancy between summoning them and then ignoring them; he wants the *idea* of reconciliation (Imaginary) but cannot tolerate the *presence* of the sons (Real).
*   **Foreclosure of Intimacy:** Notice the dialogue. He struggles to remember their names or specific details, frequently drifting into monologues that exclude them. In the hotel restaurant, his attention physically drifts away from his table toward the women. This is a defense mechanism bordering on foreclosure; he is expelling the "bad objects" (the sons who remind him of his flaws) to preserve the "good objects" (the women who reflect his grandeur).

### Aggressivity in the Mirror
Aggression masks deep psychic fragility.
He rejects the sons to maintain his idealized self-image.
Lacan posited that "aggressivity" is the correlative tension of the narcissistic mode. When the unity of the ego is threatened, the subject lashes out.
*   **The Narcissistic Injury:** When the sons attempt to engage him on a human level, asking about his health or his life, Young-hwan becomes evasive or oddly cruel. He cannot answer because to do so would be to acknowledge he is just a man, not a myth.
*   **Disavowal:** He engages in *disavowal* (Verleugnung). He acknowledges the sons are there ("I called you"), but simultaneously acts as if they are irrelevant intruders in his communion with the "angels." The snow-covered landscape of the film mirrors this blank slate he desires—a world without the muddy tracks of his past, a white void where he can project a new, guilt-free self.

**Conclusion: The Leap**

The analysis reveals a tragedy.
He chooses the imaginary over the reality of kinship.
Young-hwan’s behavior is not a preparation for death, but a defense against the "little death" of shame. By clinging to the admiring gaze of strangers, he attempts to freeze himself in a state of imaginary wholeness, leaving his sons to wander the freezing cold of his emotional neglect.

Here lies the final question.
Is the hotel actually a purgatory of his own making?
If we accept that the protagonist uses the women to hallucinate a cohesive self, we must ask: Is Young-hwan’s eventual death in the narrative a biological event, or is it the inevitable psychic collapse that occurs when the Imaginary dissolves? Perhaps the film suggests that for the narcissist, the moment the mirror is removed and the Other no longer watches, existence itself becomes impossible—we do not die when our hearts stop, but when we can no longer find a pair of eyes to validate our delusions.
