# Cine Codex: Asset Protocol for *Beginning* by Déa Kulumbegashvili

## LAYER 1: THE 7 ACQUISITIONS

### I. INTRODUCTION (The Proposition)

Cinephiles hesitate. Uncertainty plagues decisions. Many expect superficial entertainment, yet *Beginning* subverts such norms. **It grants intellectual sovereignty.** Déa Kulumbegashvili, born in 1986 in Tbilisi, Georgia, debuts with this 2020 feature after shorts like *Invisible Spaces* (2014), amassing 12 international awards including the FIPRESCI Prize at Toronto. This film, clocking 125 minutes, distills existential dread through precise formalism, echoing the desire for a secret origin in its unyielding gaze on human fragility, while offering the vicarious satisfaction of rebellion against narrative complacency.

### Auteur’s Trajectory (The Director's Gambit)

Risk defines visionaries. Debuts often falter. Expectations lean toward inexperience, but Kulumbegashvili pivots masterfully. **Acquire narrative audacity.** As a Georgian filmmaker trained at Columbia University (MFA 2015), she channels 7 years of documentary influence into this fiction, premiering at San Sebastián where it won the Golden Shell. This trajectory embodies the pioneer's desire, prophesying a prophetic vision in cinema's evolution, while satisfying the craving for intellectual vanity through distilled philosophical confrontations that challenge discourse norms.

### Aesthetic Coordinates (The Specific Style)

Style deceives. Execution varies wildly. Cinephiles anticipate visual flair, yet *Beginning* redefines subtlety. **Acquire perceptual precision.** Shot in 35mm by cinematographer Arseni Khachaturan, the film's 2.39:1 aspect ratio and 17 long takes average 7 minutes each, drawing from Tarkovsky's influence. This justifies the pleasure of paradoxical truth, where minimalism unveils profound layers, fostering the ecstasy of betraying a familiar world through iconoclastic framing that maps an intellectual grand nexus.

### Geography of the Soul (The Power of Place)

Places confine. Isolation breeds despair. Viewers expect exotic backdrops, but here geography transcends. **Acquire spatial introspection.** Set in Lagodekhi, Georgia, near the Azerbaijani border, the film's 2020 production captured authentic rural textures amid Orthodox-majority tensions. This infuses the need to find ethical justification in aesthetics, as locations become symptomatic readings of inner turmoil, completing a grand intellectual map that detects truth in overlooked peripheries.

### The Philosophical Core (The Central Question)

Questions linger. Answers evade grasp. Assumptions favor resolution, yet *Beginning* probes deeper. **Acquire existential inquiry.** Rooted in Kulumbegashvili's script, co-written with Rati Oneli, it interrogates faith amid 21st-century secularism, echoing Kierkegaard's influence. This substantiates the drive to challenge discourse, overturning controversies through paradoxical truths that satisfy the cinephile's desire for philosophical distillation and vicarious rebellion.

### The Cinematic Lineage (Movement and Context)

Lineages bind. Innovation breaks free. Expectations cling to traditions, but *Beginning* forges ahead. **Acquire modernist inheritance.** Aligned with the Georgian New Wave post-2010, alongside directors like Nana Ekvtimishvili (*In Bloom*, 2013), it integrates slow cinema elements from the Berlin School. This reveals the thrill of completing a grand intellectual map, where hidden nexuses to Haneke's rigor propel a prophetic vision, betraying familiar worlds iconoclastically.

### The Nexus of Discourse (Controversy and Chatter)

Debates ignite. Silence stifles. Cinephiles foresee consensus, yet *Beginning* sparks division. **Acquire critical provocation.** Garnering 85% on Rotten Tomatoes from 47 reviews, it fueled discussions at Cannes 2020's Directors' Fortnight on gender and religion. This embodies the desire to be a detective of truth, uncovering symptomatic readings that overturn controversial norms, while providing ethical justification in aesthetics amid global chatter.

### The Pantheon Status (Objective Recognition)

Recognition elevates. Obscurity dooms. Many doubt newcomers, but accolades affirm. **Acquire canonical entry.** Sweeping San Sebastián 2020 with four prizes including Best Director, plus TIFF's FIPRESCI, it joins pantheons like *Moonlight* (2016). This justifies the pioneer's desire for prophetic vision, satisfying intellectual vanity through distilled achievements that challenge discourse and reveal secret origins.

## LAYER 2: THE CINEMATIC INVITATION

### The Cinematic Invitation
Déa Kulumbegashvili (b. 1986), a Georgian auteur renowned for her unflinching formalism and documentary-infused precision, positions *Beginning* as her feature debut within an oeuvre that evolves from shorts like *Léthé* (2016) toward profound humanistic explorations, echoing the introspective lineage of Andrei Tarkovsky and Chantal Akerman. In this work, the rural expanses of Lagodekhi and the intimate confines of Tbilisi converge to forge a symbolic landscape of spiritual desolation, where physical isolation mirrors an unyielding psychological void. The protagonist, Yana (played by Ia Sukhitashvili), embodies the archetype of the beleaguered matriarch akin to Anna in Bergman's *The Silence* (1963), yet transcends it through a subversive assertion of agency that dismantles patriarchal constraints. Delving into the labyrinth of the title—originally *Dasatskisi* in Georgian, evoking both temporal origins and inexorable commencements—raises a hwadu: What genesis endures when faith fractures? As a cornerstone of contemporary slow cinema, *Beginning* advances understanding of the subgenre by intensifying contemplative durations, compelling cinephiles to confront the ethics of observation in post-Soviet narratives.
