### The Director's Ledger: Hong Sang-soo's *Hotel by the River* (2018)

#### 1. The Balance Sheet (The Situation Immediately Before)
In early 2017, Hong Sang-soo, then 56, faced a precarious career juncture amid personal scandal and financial precarity. His preceding film, *On the Beach at Night Alone* (2017), budgeted at approximately $200,000 through Jeonwonsa Film Co., grossed a modest $500,000 globally, yielding slim profits after its Berlin International Film Festival premiere in February 2017, where lead Kim Min-hee won the Silver Bear for Best Actress. This followed *Yourself and Yours* (2016), with a $150,000 budget and $300,000 gross, underscoring Hong's niche art-house brand but exposing vulnerabilities: a March 2017 public divorce filing amid affair rumors with Kim eroded investor confidence, leading to severed ties with major Korean distributors like CJ Entertainment. By mid-2017, Hong's risk profile with backers was high—his films averaged 1.5x returns but relied on festival prestige, not mass appeal—driving a strategic pivot to introspective, low-stakes projects to rebuild autonomy amid career bottlenecks.

#### 2. The Investment (The Specifics of the Gamble)
Hong self-financed *Hotel by the River* through Jeonwonsa, his production company, with a micro-budget of roughly $100,000, sourced from personal funds and small Korean investors, bypassing major studios. Production spanned a tight 10 days in December 2017 at the Hotel Ara in Gangwon Province, South Korea. Risks centered on the film's austere, dialogue-driven narrative of mortality and regret, shot in black-and-white, which courted market irrelevance in a blockbuster-dominated era; politically, its autobiographical echoes of Hong's scandals amplified controversy in conservative Korea. Personally, Hong deferred his salary and leveraged relationships with recurring collaborators like Kim Min-hee and producer Kim Jae-woo, investing two years of creative capital post-scandal to gamble on festival validation over commercial viability.

#### 3. The Execution (Managing the Risk)
Production clashed Hong's minimalist vision with fiscal constraints, including a rushed schedule amid winter shoots at the remote Hotel Ara, where snowstorms caused minor delays but no reported overruns. A key conflict arose with initial backers over the black-and-white format, which Hong insisted upon for thematic starkness, escalating costs by 10-15% for specialized post-production at Seoul's Finecut lab. This aesthetic choice heightened risk by alienating broader audiences but mitigated financial exposure through efficient, improvised shooting—reducing crew to 15 and forgoing reshoots—ultimately preserving the budget while amplifying the film's introspective gamble.

#### 4. The Return on Investment (The Aftermath)
Released February 15, 2019, in South Korea via Finecut, *Hotel by the River* premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in August 2018, winning Best Actor for Ki Joo-bong; it grossed $150,000 globally against its $100,000 budget, achieving modest profitability. The outcome bolstered Hong's auteur cachet, securing a multi-picture deal with Finecut in 2019 for international distribution. This directly enabled his next project, *The Woman Who Ran* (2020), which premiered at Berlin and won the Silver Bear for Best Director, extending his festival-driven trajectory despite ongoing domestic scrutiny.
